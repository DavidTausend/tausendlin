The project's color scheme is inspired by the Tausendlin flag, featuring cherry red (#990011) for emphasis and dark grey (#201E20) for body text, creating a professional contrast. The header background is pure white (#FFFFFF) for clear readability. Social network icons are highlighted with distinct colors: blue (#0000FF) for Facebook and Twitter, deep red (#e60f00) for YouTube, and orange-brown (#d24d14) for Instagram.

### Components

## Testing

### Automated Testing

#### Validator Testing

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_desktop.webp"></div>

The W3C Markup Validator confirms the HTML is error-free, ensuring compliance with web standards, as indicated by the Lighthouse report.

##### CSS

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_desktop.webp"></div>

Validated error-free by the Jigsaw validator, the CSS effectively enhances the site's performance and cross-browser compatibility, as shown in the Lighthouse report.

#### LightHouse

Lighthouse was employed to evaluate the website's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO via Chrome Developer Tools. Future plans include regular Lighthouse audits to continually enhance these aspects, ensuring optimal site efficiency and user experience.

##### Desktop

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_desktop.webp"></div>

##### Mobile

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_mobile.webp"></div>

##### Improvements

Given the initial suboptimal performance score, I delved into identifying and rectifying the factors contributing to this issue:

- Image Optimization: Recognizing that large image files significantly affect loading times, I optimized all images. This included resizing, compressing, and choosing appropriate file formats without compromising quality.

- Minifying Resources: I implemented the minification of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files. This process removes unnecessary characters from the code, reducing file size and improving load times.

- Eliminating Render-Blocking Resources: I identified and deferred loading non-critical JavaScript and CSS files that were hindering the initial page rendering.

##### Final Score

After implementing these improvements, the final Lighthouse scores reflect significant enhancements in both desktop and mobile performance:

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_desktop_final.webp"></div>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/lighthouse_mobile_final.webp"></div>

These final scores demonstrate the successful optimization of the website, resulting in better performance, accessibility, and overall user experience.

##### Accessibility

My mentor advised me to utilize the WAVE tool to analyze my website. During this process, we encountered several errors, including low contrast issues on the slideshow and form buttons. To address this, I altered the button colors to black, enhancing their prominence and significantly improving the contrast for better readability.

### Bugs

#### Known Bugs

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/know_issue.webp"></div>

- Animation Cursor Positioning: On the welcome animation, the cursor appears in the middle on small devices but at the end on larger screens, creating a noticeable inconsistency.

#### Solved Bugs

- Gallery Description Visibility: Initially, the gallery wasn't displaying the full descriptions of images on smaller screens. This was resolved by reducing the text size and adding a scroll feature for extended descriptions, ensuring readability and accessibility across all devices.
- Layout Inconsistencies: Adjusted CSS for consistent appearance across browsers and devices.
- Social Media Link Functionality: Ensured all social media links are operational and open in new tabs.
