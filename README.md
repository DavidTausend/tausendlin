##### Improvements

Given the initial suboptimal performance score, I delved into identifying and rectifying the factors contributing to this issue:

+ Image Optimization: Recognizing that large image files significantly affect loading times, I optimized all images. This included resizing, compressing, and choosing appropriate file formats without compromising quality.

+ Minifying Resources: I implemented the minification of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files. This process removes unnecessary characters from the code, reducing file size and improving load times.

+ Eliminating Render-Blocking Resources: I identified and deferred loading non-critical JavaScript and CSS files that were hindering the initial page rendering.
